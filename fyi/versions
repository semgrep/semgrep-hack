      Track corpus (#27)
      
      - Tracks corpus file
        - Reasoning: Downstream, ocaml-tree-sitter assumes that corpus tests have been committed to the tree-sitter repo. To test against regressions, it symlinks and runs the tests. See https://github.com/returntocorp/ocaml-tree-sitter-semgrep/blob/cabfe800af79188f69bd7b4380cf54274f6db790/lang/semgrep-grammars/src/prep.common#L27-L36. We want these tests to run.
      - Ensures build files are up to date in PRs
        - Reasoning: Will catch any corpus or tree-sitter gen discrepancies
      
      To verify that action is working, reference purposefully failed actions below in 45633b0 (see https://github.com/slackhq/tree-sitter-hack/runs/3284730037).
